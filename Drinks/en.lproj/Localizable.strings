This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos. So I decided to change that and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.";
